Paolo Pedercini is behind Molleindustria. Since 2003 they have produced artisanal remedies to the idiocy of mainstream entertainment in the form of short experimental games. Their products range from satirical business simulations (McDonaldâ€™s Video game, Oiligarchy) to meditations on labor and alienation (Every Day the Same Dream, Unmanned), from playable theories (To Build a Better Mousetrap, A Short History of the Gaze) to agitprop games (Democratic Socialism Simulator, Casual Games for Protesters, and Phone Story). And on a personal note: when I was in grad school and was wholly convinced that games were not a fruitful pursuit, it was the games of Molleindustria that convinced me I was an idiot.
